# archetype-vaadin-addon

A project template for Vaadin add-ons that...

 * makes it easy to develop the add-on (UI tests in same module as the actual add-on)
 * makes OSGi compatible add-ons by default
 * emphasis testing: supports multiple UI tests with a searchable listing, setup for automated browser level testing
 * does NOT support GWT extensions (only pure server side and JS extensions, a similar archetype with GWT support on TODO)
